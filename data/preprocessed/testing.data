woman immediately called her husband at the where he worked to tell him what she had &name came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via type of report to addresses that he obtained off the &name everyday after school for the past &num months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom just got the &num day and figured what the heck put my name on it like the instructions said and started sending it out says the clever the letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num &num dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the list get junk all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing &num bills about week later rode my bike down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it there was also yellow slip that said had to go up to the post office counter thought was in trouble or something laughs he goes on went up to the counter and they had whole box of more mail for me had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the the money just kept coming in and just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework &name had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the &num bills for &num &num and hundreds did want the banks to get suspicious so kept riding to different banks with like &num thousand at time in my backpack would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money &website time the lady gave me really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but just rode to the next bank down the street &website reporting news team examined and investigated the the boy was sending out and found that it was not at &name fact it was

few people have spotted the evidence that we have started using problem tracking system for dealing with queries to the system administrators although the system should be largely transparent this is just quick note to explain what is going on and how you can help the system to run smoothly problem with support addresses such as is that of ensuring that every problem is dealt with by somebody and that we try to avoid wasted effort by having more than &num person pick up the same message secondary problem is that of keeping track of the correspondence for problem especially when responsibility is transferred from &num person to another we are therefore experimenting with problem tracking system called &website whenever problem enters the system is is assigned unique ticket number which is put into the subject line of all further correspondence you can help the system run smoothly by observing these guidelines please try to confine an initial message to single problem or very closely related problems if you put completely unrelated matters in single message it may be difficult to handle them in parallel or supplementary question may be missed if you want to add some correspondence to an existing query always reply to message which includes the ticket number if you have one we will shortly be arranging that an automatic reply is sent out when ticket is created if you want to add more information before you have had reply from human you can reply to this the system is being introduced gradually so in the short term you may find that some questions are answered the old way whilst others are given tickets when we believe ticket has been resolved you should get message saying so if you agree do nothing if you disagree either immediately or after some time replying to message which has the ticket number will automatically reopen it with the advantage that we will be able to see the previous correspondence instantly

dear all &name &name from the &name will present seminar to the &name group entitled solubility and interfaces of monomeric proteins date 23rd april wednesday time transport &num &num tennis &name road in front of the new &name department &num &num &name roundabout and back after the talk can people who are planning on using the bus please email back to me so that we have some idea of the numbers on the bus also as you know there is &name talk at the &name on the 22nd april there will also be bus running to this talk leaving &name &name at &num 40am abstract &name is understood in the relationship between the sequence structure and solubility of protein however it is clear that the function of protein is intimately related to its solubility namely that structural proteins are insoluble while enzymes must have very high solubility our inability to predict solubility presents practical difficulties especially for &name &name initiatives as up to &num of proteins cannot be crystallised due to insolubility of the sample furthermore it seems plausible that the mechanisms responsible for the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils are similar to those at play in the formation of the random insoluble aggregates that form in inclusion bodies it is clear that the hydrophobic or polar content of the surface of protein plays key role in its solubility given the collective behaviour of water we hypothesise that individual surface residues may not necessarily play decisive role in dictating its solubility but that patches of residues may well do so to examine this we construct score based on the average hydrophobic polar content of surface patches of atoms or residues over set of &num monomeric proteins to see if the resulting distribution of scores is unusal we compare the distribution of scores for each protein with the scores from an equivalent randomised surface we can also examine the variation of the score for each patch over homologous proteins here too we can compare the distribution of scores with scores generated from randomised sequences in the first case we find that the atomic patch score have distributions with shorter tails than those generated from the randomised surfaces indicating that the surface atoms are arranging themselves so as to avoid extrema of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity perhaps more interestingly in the case of examining the hydrophobic patch score as it varys over sequences we find that hydrophobic patches tend to be supressed suggesting that surface residues can evolve in collective fashion we argue that this confirms our initial hypothesis what its consequences are and some future research we can carry out hope to see many of you at the talk regards &name subscribe or unsubscribe from &name by sending an email with title subscribe &name or unsubscribe &name to &email

thanks for your replies question now if you allow me in very large number of cases see that the tokenizer has returned words for which the lemma is ended by backslash among others when the words are in capitals in title is that something that comes from the original data or is it meaningful indication of some linguistic feature about that word in other words can safely delete any trailing in lemmas another question related in first attempt at creating database modified all lemmas to have them lowercase so as to avoid having duplicate lemmas however started thinking that the case information is important for proper names and so on &name among all the cases of capital letters there are &num types meaningful cases proper nouns with leading capital acronyms with more than &num capital or only capital letters and the meaningless &num as far as semantics is concerned initial word in sentence with leading capital titles and other highlighted words with only capital letters when the first type is interesting to have in the &name the second is not unfortunately it is impossible to distinguish the cases what do you think is best then &name all information or keeping all cases as in the original data thanks in advance &name

hi thanks lot for looking at the data &num sorry for misleading you about tokenisation we did leave upper cases in when we parsed what we sent you was file produced afterwards that included samplenumbers so that the examples can be tracked and was lower cased after parsing and which we used for extraction of the roles but the sentences submitted to the parser had the upper case preserved realise now that this was the wrong thing to do and that forgot to mention this however the mistakes that you attributed to tokenisation are now all tagging mistakes so that your tagging comments now probably hold for these examples thus the &name islands case has the followign tokenisation and then the tagger for whatever reason removes the upper case for islands abstract &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &num &char &num &num tagger output and parser input &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name to_to &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name we also see islands as the head thus if islands would have been parsed as subject we are happy and see the whole country name as subject role and the parse as correct instead of tokenisation we have such mapping in the role extraction module so we are ok on that the same holds for the other tokenisation cases that now are all tagging problems the &name &name example normally the tagger gets this right as proper name byut in &num case it did &num thanks for the comments about the parse timeout and the tagging thresholding it looks as if this might solve lot of our cases &name weighting might be sensible too as we do mostly care about precision not recall in cases where grammatical functions are missed we can default to literal baselines which is very good baseline instead if precision is low we overgenerate metonymies &num &name precision and recall for subjects and objects were only talked about precision at talk as this is more important to us at the moment &name &char &num recall &num thus over &num as you said &name precision &num recall &num &name are rounded note that the datasets are very small &num subjects and &num objects in our dataset as most country names are pps thanks again for all the help best &name &name &name language technology group university of &name &num &name &name &name &name &name &email &name &num &num &num &num &name &num &num &num &num
hi as might have been very correctly observed by several of you at different stages although it is small one which should logically help our &name group lacks some of the characteristics that would justify that appellation we know little or nothing about each other research methods sometimes even interests this is something know some of us have at some point felt sorry about luckily &name and &name have now decided to give it try they asked me to organize something that would allow everyone to get the chance to explain what they are doing on an informal basis however for the aim to be reached it is important that everyone of us takes part in the event attendance is therefore highly recommended not to say obligatory the plan given that we are &num of us is to held &num afternoons at few weeks interval all members of the group would give &num min talk &num on each afternoon rather than being about results of the research only these talks should mostly be short description of current research methods and tools used and designed problems met points that can be useful for the entire group and about which some useful feedback or ideas could be given by other members of the group after each talk &num min would indeed be allocated for questions and or comments after the talks we would then do something together and &name has already offered to host pizza drinks at his place for one of the afternoons everything is possible and if you got any idea let me know dates for the &num afternoons have been already suggested &name &num or &name &num june &name &num or &name &num july we want to make sure that everyone could attend therefore please send me your comments about these dates if you definitely ca make &num or several of them think this is wonderful idea &name going for sure we can make something of it provided everyone puts little goodwill into it be these events so please send me all comments directly if you think this is not the best way of doing it feel free to send any other idea as well cheers &name

&name am planning to work on the final workplan for the next &num days in the lab and was wondering if could meet you briefly regarding this on &name wed many thanks &name &name overloaded with spam with &name &num you can filter it out &website
think that lab demonstrating charges should continue to be shared ie we pay for all speech related demonstrators and &name pay for all language related &num where we agree to remedial treatment are grey area and actually harder to find an account to charge against on the assumption that these are very rare perhaps we should charge these against the &name money if it becomes apparent that we are going to fail to spend all our &name money then we might change the above &name
&num thing that think we ought to discuss before the projects are marked is the feedback that we give the students on the projects at the moment we do tell them anything which assume is because the course is over and because technically we should tell them anything until it ratified by &org but do think this is consistent with the university policy on retention of exam results since we actually keep the marks ourselves and supply information in references the general university policy is that we should tell students everything that might provide useful feedback personally think we should give the students letter grades not necessarily immediately after the exam it could wait till &org has okayed them and it could be something that was only disclosed on request but think this is the sort of thing that should be discussed since do want to lumber any future examiners with choice that seems unreasonable &name

dear colleagues do not know the history of corporate involvement by the &name in public issues of language use and language politics further back than &num however agree with &name &name and &name &name in regretting the public position taken by some of the past presidents of &name on the matter of &name boycott or rather in regretting the manner of taking it do think it matters that my dues are not currently paid up as it is clearly the general intention of the &name to represent &name in &name would be very surprised if members of the mass media did not take the letter in question as &name facto representing majority opinion in the linguistics community no matter how carefully the authors qualify their undoubtedly honourable intentions since such qualifications are exactly the sort of thing that gets overlooked by in general and the media in particular in that respect very much appreciated april &name stance in refusing to endorse the letter without formal support from the membership it not clear to me from reading the past presidents letter why they felt it necessary to go forward without securing such support or perhaps discovering its absence the &name affair has been reported for some months now and the letter does not appear to highlight any radically new or developments it also not clear to me what committee april letter refers to some of this may be down to my ignorance of developments at the last meeting am however familiar with the participation of the linguistic society of &name in matters of public interest concerning language over the last &num years while the &name has not always been effective or unproblematic in its approach it has generally sought member approval in an organised fashion for statements and resolutions sometimes as in the &name case within few weeks after significant events occurred more importantly in recent years it has voiced corporate opinion primarily on issues in which &name are significantly united and which fall under our professional remit such as the harmful misconceptions underlying the movement &num the protection of basic language rights &num the systematicity of african american english and the pedagogical soundness of the &name school system approach in the ebonics controversy &num the academic effectiveness of bilingual education &num and the adequacy of signed languages &num see webpage at &website these cases the burden for summarising research and drafting statement for presentation to the membership has indeed fallen on &num individual as in the contrasting case &name describes but it is then handled through the committee on social and political concerns in regular way perhaps some such more elaborated structure might be useful for &name in view of the concerns that members have voiced the issues of academic freedom raised in the past presidents letter are indeed important &num for all academics but cannot see that there is anything linguistic about them other than the content of the journal in question which has not surfaced as an issue in any of the reports have seen it thus seems fair to clarify why &name should collectively address this issue and similar &num which may arise in future and how this can best be done sincerely &name &char &name dept of language and &name university of &name &email

she came across large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and skateboard in the back of her sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash &name bills &num &num and hundreds all neatly in labelled piles first thought was that he had robbed bank says the woman there was over &num &num dollars in that bag that more than my husband earns in year the woman immediately called her husband at the where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via type of report to addresses that he obtained off the &name everyday after school for the past &num months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom just got the &num day and figured what the heck put my name on it like the instructions said and started sending it out says the clever the letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num &num dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in &name bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the list get junk all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing &num bills about week later rode my bike down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it there was also yellow slip that said had to go up to the post office counter thought was in trouble or something laughs he goes on went up to the counter and they had whole box of more mail for me had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the the money just kept coming in and just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework &name had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the &num bills for &num &num and hundreds &website reporting news team examined and investigated the the boy was sending out and found that it was not at &name fact it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name &name &num section &num and &num or title &num section &num in the us code also in

hi dr &name like to do an intensive but &name my specific area of interest is the commercially useful analysis of business language text this may include for example analysis of political bias positive negative tone identification of recommendations and rating of risk backgrounded myself already reading quite few papers and books on sentiment classification and information extraction about to embark on machine learning have no experience of academic linguistics but have been an information architect in web systems for clients such as &name &name and news international have &num degree in civil engineering &num &name &name &name and &num years experience in strategic marketing and business information systems currently &num and director in growing web software company wonder if you could give me some idea of &char my suitability to &name &char whether could work on distance learning basis &char whether the timing of my application fits with the application schedule have attached summary of my interests below &name regards &name &name &name all out &name &website email &email &num &name road &name &name &name &website &num &num &num direct &num &num &num main &num rationale recent research in the areas of sentiment classification information extraction and machine learning applied to language processing has resulted in systems which can intelligently interpret documents with respect to particular tasks this work has achieved success rates which are scientifically significant indeed in some experimental applications success rates have approached those of humans many researchers have created innovative techniques to harness diverse range of text resources including search engines thesauri and internet content however we are still some way off the success rates of human interpretation in the commercial field perhaps now is the right time to start the development of commercially satisfactory machine interpretation &name which can achieve interpretation within the wide limits of commercial applications ultimately &name success will be measured by its adoption within the market initially however the commercial market needs to exert its influence on this field and researchers need to understand commercial expectations to examine their implications on outputs and inputs and to develop viable trial systems this is where wish to focus my attention &num research interests my research interests are in the applied ie commercially useful relationship between information extraction ie summarising key facts and sentiment classification in particular am concerned with defining the potential applications of this relationship within business context and in attempting to achieve accuracy which is acceptable to the market within defined scope possibly close to human accuracy levels wish to demonstrate that single engine should be able to both perform and relate information extraction and sentiment classification simultaneously from natural language in common business use mainly through shallow techniques in machine learning furthermore hope to show that typical business person should be able to operate such system given mixture of and input parameters and achieve an accuracy which is high enough to satisfy commercial expectations perhaps over &num for example would hope that my work will contribute towards making the following activity possible market analyst submits &num articles from the financial &name on the footwear industry to an online service she enters the key topic areas of interest eg growth risk retail demand innovation online service produces summary of key facts and related author sentiments on these topics clear statement of certainty on each area &num proposed research intend to conduct applied research into

hi &name think it definitely makes sense for me to evaluate my thing on the &name subjects should be straightforward read up on what &name did for objects and obliques my algorithm is actually more involved than her baseline for example it looks like the base line would &name anything at &num position as subject mine would if it was in &name or appositive similarly the basline would probably find an object relation between every verb and &name in &num position mine would if there was relation with the next verb for example in he said the ball was &name also her evaluation is for all &name my evaluation is for only &num so do think my &num is incompatible with her baseline of &num but it makes sense for me to evaluate against her as well for my thesis the reason have confidence in my algo is that been through the mistakes my anaphora resolution algorithm makes and they tend not to be due to incorrect &name labelling actually did the evaluation on the gold standard afterwards when was writing the paper not claiming that an approach so shallow can handle all &name but think it will do ok even on the &name for subjects and objects &char

struggling business at that moment something significant happened in my life and am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life financially forever in mid december received this program via &num month prior to receiving this program had been sending away for information on various business opportunities all of the programs received in my opinion were not cost effective they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not one claimed that would make million dollars in &num year it did tell me have to write best selling book to make it but as was saying in december of &num received this program did send for it or ask for it they just got my name off mailing list thank goodness for that after reading it several times to make sure was reading it correctly could believe my eyes here was money making phenomenon could invest as much as wanted to start without putting me further into debt after got pencil and paper and figured it out would at least get my money back but like most of you was still little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all so checked it out with the &name &name office &num &num and they confirmed that it is indeed legal after determining the program was legal and not chain letter decided why not initially sent out &num &num the great thing about is that do need any money for printing to send out the program and because all of my orders are fulfilled via the only expense is my time telling you as it is hope it does

another comment on anonymisation the problem is even worse if one wishes to make available for whatever purpose the audio or video tapes from which transcriptions have been prepared believe that considering this more challenging case also clarifies issues for corpora assume video which is the extreme point there are &num problems with video no amount of signal manipulation however small preserves the full scientific usefulness of the data on the other hand no reasonable amount of anonymisation however large really ensures anonymity the first point is obvious if one contemplates trying to do experiments with the data it would for example seriously compromise comprehension study if proper names are bleeped out or even replaced by others no psychology reviewer would ever accept that such data is as naturalistic as untreated data the second point is almost as obvious because humans are adept at inferring personal identity from all kinds of things including voice quality ear shape gait and so on therefore whatever &num does short of blanking everything out it is difficult to credibly claim that the risk of unintended identification has been avoided &name &name &name documentation makes the case that such identification is highly undesirable the only way can see to handle this is to deal with the problem at the outset by making completely clear to participants what will happen to their data and obtaining informed consent if this is not done the data is effectively lost to responsible researchers and cannot be used except at risk of infringing participants rights if as in the case &name has promises have been made to participants those promises must be honoured it may or may not be possible to recover data that is both useful and distributable under these circumstances the same difficulties are also present for audio the &name audio has never been distributed even though it exists the risk of identification is just too great and the consequences of that too severe to be acceptable although the visual cues to identity are absent speaking style persists one may feel that the risks are less but they still exist and here the rub the same arguments apply albeit more weakly to corpora while voice quality is now absent substantial cues to personal identity may persist in lexis and other idiosyncrasies not to mention that people are extremely adept at reconstructing material from context once again the risks are arguably less than in the other media but they still exist so notwithstanding valiant efforts to anonymise in such way that the scientific usefulness of the data is preserved the original decision to promise anonymity comes back to haunt us lean to the view that there is no difference of principle between the different media is even &name rigorous approach to anonymization enough in practice perhaps but that depends on very iffy judgement call the lesson seems to be that great care is needed in collecting informed consent for corpus work none of this addresses the additional point made in &name post about collateral damage to people and organisations not involved in the recording could imagine prosecution against both participants and corpus distributors for defamation or slander that would be bad perhaps corpus collectors need to indemnify participants against this or perhaps it suffices to warn people that they are in effect speaking in public place or perhaps we have duty of care to ensure that our participants do not put themselves at risk doubly likely since many corpora include contributions by children and that leaves aside the much more likely cases where nasty stuff in the corpus evokes resentment and unhappiness but not enough to lead to prosecutions &name &name &name assistant professor of computational linguistics department of linguistics &num &name avenue &name oh &num &name &num &num &num &name &num &num &num web &website

executive summary &name access to nearly all &name machines in the lab will soon cease to permit ssh &name and password based this only effects people logging into &name lab machines from outside the lab if you cannot connect please try connecting to &website and seek help from &email &name &name &name currently most machines in the lab allow access using ssh protocols &name and &name using password or publickey based authentication v1 and password access are security concerns protocol problems and keyboard sniffers respectively so &website and &website already has the restrictions will not allow ssh &name connections but will allow password based authentication as such if you try to login and there is problem try &num to check whether it is related to the changes you should be able to use the ssh or slogin command to connect from the relay machines to your desired machine feel free to use the relay machines as transition aid but note that they will not allow such access indefinitely so ensure that your ssh client can use publickey based &name access if your remote ssh client had been using ssh &name to connect to lab machines in the past the machine may only have the ssh &name public key of the lab machine so when using ssh v2 it may complain that the key is unknown if so look for the host fingerprint on the web page &website is &num &num &name ad &name &num &name c7 &name df fd &num &name &name &num &num a2 better still would be to jot down the fingerprint in advance with the fingerprint try connecting to the host again directly and when asked whether to continue check the fingerprint and continue if it is correct otherwise contact if your client does support ssh &name or publickey try upgrading to later version &name users can use &name and &name users can use putty other packages which are layered on ssh scp cvs rsync pscp &name etc will be similarly effected if you do have public key you will need to generate &num and arrange that the private part is available on the client outside the lab machine and that the public part is registered in authorized_keys in your lab filespace see &website key register it for incoming calls and converting it to suitable form for the windows ssh agent pageant use good pass phrase to encrypt the key and do not use any existing password anyone setting things up in advance can test that things are working by &website which already has the restrictions in force

2nd call for papers workshop on &name expressions &name &name and &name &num july &num &name &name websites workshop website &website &name website &website workshop description &name expressions &name include large range of linguistic phenomenon such as phrasal verbs add up nominal compounds telephone box and phrases salt and &name and they can be syntactically and or semantically idiosyncratic in nature &name are used frequently in everyday language usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into single word considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject both in terms of theory and practice but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research there is still gap between the needs of &name and the descriptive tradition of linguistics owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &name properly they pose real challenge for &name most applications tend to ignore &name or address them simply by listing however it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately this particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing machine translation summarisation generation in recent years there has been growing awareness in the &name community of the problems that &name pose and the need for their robust handling considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area some within large research projects dedicated to &name the &name expression project there is also growing interest in &name in projects focused on tasks such as parsing robust accurate &name &name &name and word sense disambiguation meaning &name &name &name language technologies which are required by applications previous workshops on &name have focused on certain &name types notably collocations terminology and named entities there are however further subtypes of &name which are highly relevant for &name tasks but which have not to date received specific attention &num example are lexicalised or &name which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation target audience this workshop is intended to bring together &name researchers working on all areas of &name the objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area to establish common themes between different approaches and to discuss future trends with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &name sub types pose for &name applications areas of interest papers are invited on but not limited to the following topics theoretical research on &name &name taxonomies classifications and databases corpus based analysis of &name analysis of &name types use and behaviour methods for identification and extraction of &name machine learning statistical or or hybrid evaluation of &name extraction methods integration of &name data into grammars and &name applications machine

at producing concise condensed representation of the key information content in an information source for particular user and task interest in automatic summarization and question answering continues to grow motivated by the explosion of information sources and advances in natural language processing and information retrieval in fact various forms of automatic summarization and question answering will undoubtedly be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the 21st century &name and question answering involves the extraction or generation of text snippets to fulfill some user needs or summarization and &name systems have shown promising results in the &name &name tracks &name &name and &name &name it is however very difficult to find good evaluation functions or rules that work well across domains or in all questions because there are many system parameters that must be carefully tuned in order to achieve good system performance in consequence various machine learning ml techniques have recently been applied to summarization and &name systems the purpose of this workshop is to provide forum for exploring the commonality underling this diversity of problem domain and approaches the workshop has the following goals to bring together communities of researchers who apply machine learning techniques to summarization and &name systems to deepen the summarization and &name community understanding of the state of the art in machine learning to identify summarization and problems for which &name techniques might be appropriate and to advance the state of the art of summarization and &name technologies topics appropriate to this workshop include summarization or &name systems with &name techniques novel or improved &name techniques

sorry meant to send this it my abstract for &name &name &name &name university &email &org &name &name building &num &name &name avenue &name &name &name &name computational model for lexical acquisition of categorial grammar model of lexical acquisition has been developed in order to learn both the semantic and syntactic category of lexemes associated with generalised categorial grammar computational simulation shows that acquisition is possible when some prior language knowledge is assumed the effects on acquisition have been explored when aspects of this prior knowledge are varied at this conference &char would present the acquisition model focusing particularly on the novel syntax learner as well as the results of acquisition experiments that have been run from different starting points in terms of the prior knowledge assumed in child language acquisition theory it has been suggested that children have an innate ability to recognise the category of particular types of words and this ability in turn helps them to determine the category of other words whether this innate ability to categorise applies to names and object words or actions words has been much discussed the difference in acquisition rate in each case is investigated the method assumes pipelined approach to acquisition each utterance in turn is first processed for the acquisition of semantic information and subsequently for the acquisition of syntactic information it is assumed that this is compatible with children behaviour it is likely that children acquire all the information they can from an utterance when they hear it and then discard it it would be impractical for the child to store many utterances to process later the syntactic learner relies on output from the semantic learner this also echos children behaviour since they pass through single word acquisition phase before they begin to acquire syntax the semantic learner produces mapping between words and their semantic representation using amongst others the theories of learning and covering constraints and is based on &name work on &name &name techniques fundamental assumption is employed to link the &num learners the number of words that the semantic category of word is dependent upon is the same as the number of words that the syntactic category is dependent upon the syntactic learner attempts to create valid parse trees for the categorial grammar thus resolving unknowns in the syntactic category types this is achieved by first assigning skeleton categories to words in the current utterance using the fundamental assumption in conjunction with information already extracted by the semantic learner all possible binary tree structures for the utterance are then considered &name trees are discarded whilst any valid trees add weighting to the syntactic categories of words at their leaf nodes for very simple example consider the sentence the grinch cries using the scenario where children have an innate ability to recognise names and objects we already know that grinch is of semantic category &name and syntactic category &char in order to find skeleton category for the remaining words we look

representations these semantic representations are the hypothesised meanings child may assume for an utterance the correct interpretation may or may not be included amongst the semantic representations the affect of this type of noise on the system may also be investigated children learn their native tongue because it is the language of their environment in the early stages of acquisition the only language that children are exposed to is that of their caketakers this implies that the caretakers utterances are the only input needed to begin acquisition to mirror this situation from which children actually learn use real data the interaction between child and her parents since the child involved did successfully learn english it is reasonable to assume that the

his approach differs from this in several respects &name syntactic learner was entirely algebraic in nature the syntactic categories were derived by solving set of simultaneous equations in order to

&name hypothesised category sets for this purpose the learner was successful but &name still made several assumptions that would correspond to innate language ability in child in order to investigate

&name &name started analysing what &name gets wrong and since it gets plenty wrong it taking while to work through it all but here are my notes on the sort of things finding if you have any input on this that be great probably find meeting to discuss these baseline results helpful quite soon try to come up with clearer picture of where and why errors occur in what sort of proportions by then thanks &name &name &name &name &name &num &name interprets whole thing as &num word which is not in the lexcison so best &name can do is say it all &num proper noun which then gets tagged as name person &name &num &num &name &name &name only recognises this format as num not date &num num &name &name harbor &num pearl harbor untagged occurs in capitalised partially grammatical sentence interpreted as &name &char &name &char &name v_inf &name &name v_np &name np_lmta &name &name &char &name in lexicon harbored &num &name &num harbors &num nn2 &num harbour &num nn1 &num vv0 &num harbouring &num &name &num harbours &num nn2 &num harbour &num nnl1 &num harbor &num nnl1 &num &name does recognise harbor as locative noun since it treats the capitlaised word as being all lowercase &name &name &name &name &name service &num &name &name &num &name &name &num &name &name &num news service p1 p_n1 &name n1_pp1 &char &name p1 p_np &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &char &name &num &num example where &name gets the bracketing wrong however even if the bracketing was right the only entry for service in the lexicon is service &num nn1 &num it will never get tagged as &name org so nothing would be tagged as an organization &name &name &name &num &name &num &name &num &name &num again the bracketing is all wrong so we get &num single cases of name person instead of one &name &num &num untagged because the tokeniser has split the year into its own word &name &name &name &char &name &name newspapers &num &name &num &name newspaper &num nn1 &num newspaper &num nn1 &num &num nn2 &num newspapermen &num nn2 &num newspapers &num nn2 &num no lexicon entry for newspaper inclusing as &name otherwise presumably the whole n1 would be tagged org organization &name &name &num &name the &name &name &num has denied request that top &name &name &num commanders in &name &num in &name &num be absolved of blame for failing to be on alert for the japanese attack on &name &name harbor &num but the military agreed that top &name &name &num officials also must share the blame all of these are untagged since &name ca come up with parse tree not even &char fragx for this sentence &name &name &num untagged since lexcison entry is &name &num nn1 &num np1 &num never &name rear admiral &name &name &name &num rear admiral &name &name &name &num so close lexicon entries admiral &num nnsb1 &num admirals &num nnsb2 &num &name &num np1 &num &num nnsb1 &num &num nnsb1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &num &name &char &name &name &name &name &char &name since &name is cannot be interpreted as &name it is bracketed with the name n1 not the title and tagged as name person his &name &num counterpart &name gen &name &name &name &name &num his &name &num counterpart &name &name &num gen &name &name &char &name &num &name tokenisation so &name treats as &num sentences det_n1 19_app &name &char &name &name &char &name &name followed by &num &char &name and &name &name &name &char &name &name however &name is tagged as np1 since no lexicon for the abbreviation for &name &name &num nns1 &num nnsb1 &num np1 &num &num nnsb1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &num nnsb1 &num otherwise &name does okay bracketing and tagging both army and &name &name &name correctly leading up to the &name &name &num &num &num debacle leading up to the &name &name &num &num &num debacle the bracketing is slightly wrong here only &name of punctuation &char &name &name num &name &name &char &num num &name &name &num &name why is the comma included as part of the n1 also &name tags it as time not date since it recognises as month so classifies it as temporal expression but has applied its date rule &name &name date n2 &name temp n2 &name &name h0 why not &name applies it here &name &name num &name &name which is also &name followed by np num &name &name &num &name &name &num perfect bracketing but &name is not in the lexicon as nnl1 so &name guesses name person &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num in the direction of &name and &name &name advocates by criticizing top &name vy &num and &name &num officials in &name &name &num for being neither energetic nor effective in getting warnings to &name &num about alarming intelligence reports that &char &name &name rupture was just hours away in the direction of &name person &name and &name advocates by criticizing top navy and army officials in &name for being neither energetic nor effective in getting warnings to &name about alarming intelligence reports that &name rupture was just hours away &num the bracketing is way off here &name &char &name &char &num &smiley &name &char &name &name &char &num &smiley n1_pp1 &char &name p1 p_ing &name vp_pp vp_pp v_n1 &name &char &name &char &name &name &name &char &name p1 &name &char &name &name p1 p_ing &name vp_pp &name a1 adv_a1 a1 &name &name &name a1 &name so &name misses tagging other potential entities it would have correctly tagged army as organization but it would have missed tagging navy likewise dewspite it being tagged &name why does the org tag not appear here &char &name &name &name harbor &num &name &name harbor &num &name &name &name &num &name &name &num as for &name &name &name &num &name &num as for &name &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &num np1 &num &name &name &name &num &name &name &name &num perfect secretary of &name &num for secretary of defense for untagged but think this is slightly dodgy classification by the annotators absolve admiral &name &num and general &name &name &num of accountability absolve &name &name &num and &name &name of accountability &num the bracketing wrong again &name &name &char &name &name correctly identifies admiral as title part of name but then classifies the whole thing as name person rather than just the following name this is more reflection on my choise of mapping to &name classifications though on the other hand &name definitely should have bracketed of accountability together with the rest of the name and has mistagged general as an adjective presumably because also of the incorrect bracketing a1 &name &name &name p1 p_n1 &name &char &name general &num &name &num nns1 &num nnsb1 &num the &name report said the &name &num report said here &name has tagged &char the part of report named after person as person again think this is bit of grey area especially since the &name &num family is counted as person which &name also tags the &name &num family chairman of the &name &name armed services committee &num chairman of &name &name &num &name services committee &num incorrect bracketing &name det_n1 &name &char &name &name a1 &name &char &name &name but since committee is tagged &name if the bracketing was correct the classification would have been correct of &name year of &name year perfect bracketing despite punctuation but again the date rule has been applied &name anniversary of the end of &name war &num &num 50th anniversary of the end of &name war &num untagged the lexicon entry for anniversary is anniversary &num nn1 &num so no part of the fragment is classified as any sort of temporal expression &name &num and &name &name &num &name and &name &num incorrect bracketing &char &name &name &char &name &name &name in &num &num early in &num &name misses this date altogether since there is no temporal noun around so just tags it as num &name num &name &name &name &name &name &name &num &num of admiral &name &name &num surviving sons and leader of the campaign to exonerate his father said the &name report confirms the assertions of the &name &name &num and &name &name &num families that the responsibility should be broadly shared and

whilst trying to observe and not react for while so as to cut my email writing time &num cannot but reply to this string with an unequivocal no &name is definitely not waste of time but cornerstone of corpus linguistics it is obvious that for the small corpus designer &num million or less tokens markup is considerable investment in time however if one holds as do that corpus is not simple mass of data but carefully compiled selection of texts then we need means to treat them as texts to store both their general features and their particularities this the &name does in my own work in the field of english for academic purposes tend not to use the corpus header but standard individual header so as to stock all the bibliographic information and socilinguistic parameters associated with the text the depth of markup depends on my needs and time for an individual text in this way can move with ease from fully annotated single text to more lightly marked up corpus this is possible because of the encoding possibilities of the &name education is very much part of the answer easy access to vast amounts of downloadable data has meant that number of corpus &name neither know nor care about the niceties of corpus creation and the whys and wherefores of selecting and marking up data ease of access has become the main criterion potentially to the detriment of the discipline itself easy solutions do not necessarily answer the most pertinent questions it is true that all this takes time but if we throw out all that is drudgery from corpus linguistics we may find that we have thrown out our text baby with the corpus bathwater and are only left with corpora for answers back to some time consuming markup &name &name &name &name de9partement langues etrange8res applique9es &name &name et sciences &name &num rue &name &name &name &num &num lorient &name &name &name &num &num &num &num &num &num &num fax &num &num &num &num &num &num &num email &email &website dear &name yes have some sympathy with the point you make the thing that has attracted me to the &name in the past though is once the effort is made to get to grips with it and it is daunting there is usually well thought through solution contained in it for almost any problem situation you come across in encoding corpus with that said it is clear theme of the posts so far that there is at the very least an advocacy issue related to the &name in corpus linguistics which is interesting best &char interesting question related to both of these issues is that of the documentation available to educate people help potential users understand what &name is does is good for research assistant have recently been poring over couple chapters of the &name guidelines looking for guidelines relevant examples to add some markup to our already mostly corpus markup scheme although the documentation is extensive it is inadequate in many ways missing examples not very good at giving larger picture to people who are sure if they need want the &name at all or who just need some pointers to few relevant sections if the only people who can read the documentation and make use of it are information library science people who are specifically trained in that area then it no wonder &name others who are in the business of building corpora are not using it or promoting it &name &name project director &name corpus of &name &name &name &name english language institute university of &name
&name can confirm that you are allowed to continue you should have had letter by now wonder if it was sent to the wrong address or something the letter says something to the effect that you are allowed to continue but you should be aware that you are in danger of failing the course if your performance does improve next year in fact you are only slightly below the pass &name so while we hope that you could do much better next year it not the case that you have to make up large gap to pass &name
&name this workshop clearly falls within the scope of &name and my initial reaction to your email is very positive to move forwards we need more information &char we will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed preferably &num &char we need draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop you then need to give them time to produce the full paper send it out to referees allow revisions final review and accept this looks to me like 4th quarter &num or 1st quarter &num &char single issue of &name will accommodate &num or &num papers to accommodate more we would have to make it double issue how many papers do you anticipate accepting if you can answer the above then the editors can make final decision note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &name each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &num independent reviewers the guest editors make the accept reject decision but one of the regular &name editors is assigned to assist in the process probably me in this case if you have detailed questions about publication procedures please contact &name van der &name at &name for email see cc list &name

being asked to offer feedback through the royal academy of engineering on government policy on he see below appreciate any comments anyone has nearly missed this as the &name lock in the original subject line below triggered high level of spam &smiley forwarded message to &email &email subject the future of higher education from dr &name &name &name &char manager engineering policy &name wed &num &name &num &num &num &num &num the future of higher education the government recently released its white paper on the future of higher education an extensive document detailing its proposals to restructure and fund the he sector over the next &num years building up what it claims to be radical picture of freer future the report can be accessed on the website of the department for education and skills at &website although media attention has focussed on deferred financial contributions from graduates and allowing institutions to set their own course fees the paper also covers many other areas regarding the expansion funding and assessment of higher education institutes there are many points that could be made about the proposed reforms but the most important issues are presented in the attached annex it is believed important that the &name &name of engineering should comment on the white paper and am writing to number of fellows seeking views from which response may be prepared the attached outline should be used as guide although please do not feel that it is necessary to comment on all areas as we are aware that it is extensive any additional points you have to make regarding the white paper would be most welcome would appreciate if any responses could reach me by monday 17th march and look forward to hearing your opinions on this matter yours &name &name &num expansion must the sector expand any further are there benefits in having &num of the population aged &num undertake university degree the government initiatives to promote fair access include reforming the funding scheme providing grants for students from lower income families and appointing an independent access regulator to oversee admissions are these measures enough what should the government do to promote fair access to higher education is the appointment of an independent access regulator welcomed the bulk of expansion will be towards more foundation degrees are these good idea &num education and the business economy the report makes much of harnessing knowledge to wealth creation is the present government focus on the financial benefits of university education and financial returns from university research damaging can the benefits of academia whether research or teaching be measured in purely financial terms in order to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and business the government is setting up network of knowledge exchanges and increasing the funding to the higher education innovation fund are such initiatives worthwhile or would the funding be better spent in other ways &num funding of infrastructure and teaching the government is aiming to undo the years of in higher education this is to be accomplished by increasing the funding available by more than &num percent over the next &num years developing incentives to support and improve research investing more in leading research departments and increasing spending on research are these measures enough are the figures the government provides enough to reverse the trend of under investment in this sector should universities be allowed to set their own fees or graduate contributions per course is it fair to tie such fees to an access &name &char can the government do more to encourage the creation of endowment funds &num student finance are the proposals for student finance fair is it reasonable to ask students to contribute to their education by paying fees is deferred contribution the best way to administer this &name the current proposals to increase student debt act as deterrent to students contemplating entry into higher education is the introduction of higher levels of student debt at odds with the governments aim to increase access to universities the proposals for student debt do not take into consideration the fact that large proportion of women take career breaks to raise family with the average salary for women graduates lower than that of men this would mean that most women would take longer to pay back their student debts than their male counterparts does the governments proposals for deferred contributions disadvantage women &num research assessment the government aims to develop criteria to assess the strength and quality of research is this necessary or welcomed should the government be directly involved in the choice of the type of research that is funded is creating new &num category in the research assessment exercise necessary &num teaching the government has proposed new national professional standards for teaching and new body to develop and promote good teaching the &name &name &name are these welcomed the government has proposed national training programme for external examiners is this necessary the university title will be made dependent on teaching degree awarding powers meaning it will no longer be necessary to have research degree awarding powers to become university is it wise to divorce teaching and research in this manner should university have to award research as well as teaching degrees is there demand for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to deal with student complaints should government provide legislation for this &num are there any other points that you think should be raised regarding this paper end of

recently received this and like most people was skeptical of what read so done some investigating on the net because like everyone else hate getting scammed as delved into the deep corridors of the vast information on the &name was astonished how many times bumped into this program there are many many people involved with it and had to wonder about all the money being transferred between them of which you and would like share parents of &num year &name find &num &num cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on major nightly news program &name and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods &name &name his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and skateboard in the back of her son closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash bills &num &num and hundreds all neatly in labeled piles first thought was that he had robbed bank says the woman there was over &num &num dollars in that bag that more than my husband earns in year the woman immediately called her husband at the where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boy school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via type of report to addresses that he obtained off the &name everyday after school for the past &num months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom just got the &num day and figured what the heck put my name on it like the instructions said and started sending it out says the clever the letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num &num dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the list get junk all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing &num bills about week later rode my bike down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it there was also yellow slip that said had to go up to the post office counter thought was in trouble or something laughs he goes on went up to the counter and they had whole box of more mail for me had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the the money just kept coming in and just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the &num bills for &num &num and hundreds did want the banks to get suspicious so kept riding to different banks with like &num thousand at time in my backpack would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me &num time the lady gave me really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the the boy was sending out and found that it was not at all in fact it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name &name &num section &num and &num or title &num section &num in the us code also in the code of federal regulations &name &num sections &num and &num which state product or service must be exchanged for money received every bill that he received contained little note that read please send me report number &name simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging service &char report on for fee this is the end of the

brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and skateboard in the back of her sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash &name bills &num &num and hundreds all neatly in labelled piles first thought was that he had robbed bank says the woman there was over &num &num dollars in that bag that more than my husband earns in year the woman immediately called her husband at the where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via type of report to addresses that he obtained off the &name everyday after school for the past &num months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom just got the &num day and figured what the heck put my name on it like the instructions said and started sending it out says the clever the letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num &num dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in &name bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the list get junk all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing &num bills about week later rode my bike down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it there was also yellow slip that said had to go up to the post office counter thought was in trouble or something laughs he goes on went up to the counter and they had whole box of more mail for me had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the the money just kept coming in and just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework &name had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the &num bills for &num &num and hundreds &website reporting news team examined and investigated the the boy was sending out and found that it was not at &name fact it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name &name &num section &num and &num or title &num section &num in the us code also in the code of federal regulations &name

have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember &name reaps the reward this is legitimate business you are offering product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in short period of time after you have ordered all &num reports take this

there are &num primary methods to get this venture going method &num by sending bulk legally let say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only &num &num each let also assume that the mailing receives only &num &num &num of &num response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &num also many people will send out hundreds of thousands instead of only &num &num each continuing with this example you send out only &num &num with &num response that is only &num orders for report &num those &num people responded by sending out &num &num each for total of &num &num out of those &num &num only &num responded with orders people responded and ordered report &num those &num people mail out &num &num each for total of &num &num the &num response to that is &num orders for report &num those &num people send &num &num each for total of &num million sent out the &num response is &num &num orders for

and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make lot of money did it was &num &num in &num months remember this is assuming only &num people ordering out of &num &num you mailed to dare to think for moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &num 4th of those people mailed &num &num each or more there are &num million people on the &name worldwide and counting with thousands of more coming on line every day believe me there is any better way to make money method &num by placing free &name on the internet advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing lot of free ads on the &name will easily get larger response we strongly suggest you start with method &num and add method &num as you go along for every &num you receive all you must do is them the report they ordered that it always provide same day service on all orders this will guarantee that the they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved concealing it is simply so no &num can &name there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each report by its number name only &name always send &num cash &name currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &num sheets of paper or foil will also work on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the report you are ordering your address and your name and postal address available reports place your order for these reports now report &num the

ok one of these were me the first time the projector had been moved from the projector stand why and placed in the cupboard underneath now know this can look there but at the time just struggled on with one the second time some kind soul had removed one into the preparation room again it simple when one knows all the places they might have been hidden but at the time it easy to believe the &num has been playing up and has been removed thought it was me who borrowed one but can understand the about to lecture and need second projector but one has disappeared crisis as to the current issue suspect the &name projectors get moved because someone using the &name projectors finds they get in the way really nice solution is to arrange that the &num desks on which the projectors sit just have camera above or below so that images written in can be projected onto the &num &name projectors &name
&name finally managed to finish the review of the &name book which &name handed down to me sorry it took an extra &num weeks than expected but bunch of things came up right at the time had planned to do it anyway attaching it to this message let me know if you need anything else or if something is quite right also since this is my first book review feel free to let me know if have adequately done the job cheers &name &name &name editor &name foundations of translation &name &num &name &num &name &num pounds hardback pages &name was project for translation that lasted &num years and encompassed &num research groups primarily in &name the original goal was to develop portable translation system for german and english for the domains of appointment scheduling and travel planning later translation between german and japanese was added and both telephone translation system and remote maintenance system for &name were developed this book contains &num articles grouped into &num sections which address various aspects of the &name project the title is somewhat misleading as the phrase foundations of translation seems to imply that the book will be instructive with respect to the task or at least contain comprehensive discussion about it instead most articles of the book report on specific components and approaches developed and utilized to support translation in &name this is fine but readers should be aware that the book is in no way textbook background knowledge relevant to the individual topics is assumed by the authors of most articles having said this if the term foundations is taken to mean consideration of all the various kinds of data components techniques that could take part in performing the task then the articles of the book certainly cover the ground extensively the articles themselves vary in their focus and emphasis the stated goals of &name were essentially oriented toward producing an end application and this course provided an excellent setting for considerable amount of research to be done thus some articles could be roughly characterized as here is how we made it work while others could be captioned as here is this interesting thing we did within the scope of the project as such there is material of interest for both academically and commercially oriented readers throughout the book there is strong emphasis on producing modules that can perform their computations in and with such large number of different technologies applied in &name this should be of interest to those interested in developing various kinds of practical &name systems with all the different topics covered much more high level discussion of how the various bits and modules fit together would have been very welcome including even brief overviews of the different sections explaining basically what the different articles are about and why they are there such overviews also could have provided forum for more discussion on how well the different approaches and strategies worked out it would also have been useful to have map of the system with pointers to the articles where the relevant modules are discussed it is sometimes hard to tell what depended on what from just reading the articles and it is often necessary to several articles to properly situate them within the context of the overall system the articles are too numerous and diverse in specialization to comment on each one individually in short review by &num reviewer however will try to give an overall sense of the book contents in the remainder of this review the first section contains &num articles that provide an overview of the completed &name system and facts and figures about the project itself the overview is quite useful for getting feeling for the system as whole before launching into the articles on the specifics it provides very descriptions of some of the various components and how they fit together as well as general discussion regarding the scope of the task which was undertaken the data collection effort and software architecture it concludes by summarizing some of the lessons learned over the course of the project unfortunately only &num pages are devoted to this when in fact it seems that it would be worthy of its own chapter also the overview clearly stays focused on the successes of &name whereas it would be very beneficial for the reader whether research or application oriented to also hear about the problems that were encountered and the things that did not go so well the next section contains &num articles that deal with topics in processing spoken input with all its messy details and transforming it into representations that can be processed by the syntax semantics and translation components the first half of the section is concerned with the methodologies and techniques for speech recognition covering topics such as language identification providing robustness in the face of various noise conditions optimizations for improving the efficiency of speech recognition components and investigations into new techniques for capturing long range dependencies in language modeling the latter articles report on the creation of pronunciation dictionaries from data to provide variants for canonical pronunciations the &name and classification of prosodic information detection of emotional behavior by users and the detection and correction of speech repairs as filter process between recognition and subsequent processing stages the third section is the largest it includes &num articles addressing lexical and syntactic processing &num different approaches to parsing were developed and integrated robust chunk parser built from cascade of finite state transducers probabilistic &name parser and an optimized &name &name &name grammar &name parser these approaches which are each discussed in separate articles provided the means to balance robustness with accuracy and depth of syntactic analysis there is also further brief article describing how their results were combined while the &name parser provides full semantic analyses the chunk parser and &name parser produce only syntactic trees how interpretations are read from these trees is discussed in an article on semantic construction the use of &name syntactic framework such as &name required considerable justification in the face of the cost of developing grammars and efficient parsing techniques the third section contains an article that lays out some of the arguments for using &name over other available frameworks and answers some of the concerns regarding the efficiency and complexity of having deep analysis as such at all &num further articles describe aspects of the &name grammars which were developed for german english and japanese since the results of the &num parsers need to be integrated into single interpretation for further processing it was necessary to develop standard interface representation that abstracted from the particularities of each of the approaches for this &name &name terms &name were developed and employed and are motivated and described in detail in the fourth article in this section &name provide an underspecified flat representation that permits many different kinds of information about an utterance to be stored and accessed including basic predications scope constraints sorts discourse relations syntactic features tense and aspect and prosody the final article of this section describes the multilingual lexical databases that were developed and highlights some of the issues in dealing with the morphology of the different languages and ensuring that it was possible to retrieve translation equivalents from &num language to the other for the semantic transfer translation component there are &num articles on aspects of semantic processing in the fourth section the first discusses how the analyses produced by the &num different parsers were combined to produce single semantic output and the second deals with processing the intermediate &name hypotheses of the parsers in robust manner that corrects certain recognition errors and disfluencies in the semantic output of each parser the next paper focuses on how some of the ambiguities in &name were resolved by incorporating discourse and prosodic information the module employed for this handled aspects such as verb and adverb disambiguation anaphora and ellipsis resolution and focus projection the final article in this section relates how the semantic databases were designed to support multiple languages and ensure that they map material in given source language to comparable semantic relations in &name to assist in semantic transfer translation in the fifth section we come to descriptions of the actual translation engines employed in &name &num main approaches were explored semantic transfer statistical translation translation translation and based translation the different engines tackled the problem in significantly different ways that gave them in some cases complementary strengths and weaknesses echoing the approach to parsing discussed earlier the translations ultimately produced by the &name system were chosen from those created by these different modules based on the confidence values they assigned to their outputs the sixth section contains &num articles which address the recognition representation and use of discourse information within the system the first article explicates the representation of dialog including illocutionary force propositional content and temporal expressions and the following article discusses how dialog structures are produced for the purposes of both translation and producing multilingual summaries of the dialogs mediated by &name the final article describes the module which performs contextual disambiguation using the variety of sources of information built up during the deep processing path in &name and which plays role in semantic transfer translation the seventh section deals with sentence realization and speech synthesis first to be discussed is the &name generation component which takes the &name output by the semantic transfer translation module and determines how they should be expressed after &name is fully specified it is handed to &num syntactic realization components one which uses &name grammar &name and another which uses &name the grammars for the former realizer are compiled from the english and japanese &name grammars discussed earlier the compilation process is the subject of the second article in this section the next article deals with the creation of dialog minutes and summaries useful task which crucially relies on the dialog processing component described in the previous section and the generation component covered in this one the final article discusses the synthesis component used for producing the final spoken output of the system the articles in the eighth section describe various aspects of the data collection and corpus creation efforts and evaluation and analysis of different components of &name these include information about recording transcription treebanking and analysis of the data utilized to develop the &name system &num articles provide evaluations of the speech recognition and synthesis components and the quality of the different translation paths these evaluations were carried out at different sites from those which produced the modules which was certainly of particular importance for the translation evaluation which involved &num competing approaches there is further article on module which attempts to select the best output from one of the translation modules based on the confidence values they produce this article might have been better situated in the fourth section of the book especially since it provides some higher level discussion of the different translation approaches finally the &num articles in the ninth section deal with concerns of software architecture and integration since &name involved &num research groups with scientists and programmers with varying competencies with respect to programming skills and knowledge of software engineering it was no small task to coordinate the components that were produced at the individual sites and enable them to work together as whole special group was devoted to this task and the article on their effort provides an informative look at the technical and sociological issues which were overcome in this integration the other article describes how &name was extended to provide telephone translation services &name tackled all sorts of problems on all sorts of fronts resulting in an impressive and extensive body of work that led to &num scientific publications and &num products the project funding and activities provided an immense boost for computational linguistics research and development in &name this book provides significant insight into the project and it will be useful to researchers and commercial developers who are interested in specific aspects of translation and how they fit within the context of an overall system for translation the articles are so diverse that it is hard to imagine any single person reading all of the articles contained in the collection since only subset of them are likely to be of particular interest to any given reader nonetheless it will certainly be an excellent resource for anyone who is specifically interested in &name itself and can use it to quickly find information on all the modules in &num big handy volume

communities of the importance of evolvability tentatively defined as the capacity of populations to exhibit adaptive heritable &name partcular the symposium focuses on the relation between evolvability and sensor and effector evolution the symposium aims to encourage dialogue between various workers in areas that might benefit from possible common framework addressing evolvability and sensor effector evolution the symposium addresses &num aspects that are believed to be central in understanding fundamental biological mechanisms like information information discovery acquisition processing and transmission both on the level of populations and individuals these mechanisms are evolvability and sensor evolution &name darwinian evolution characterized by heritable variation and selection is not by itself sufficient to account for the capacity to vary and inherent phenotypic expressions of fitness rigidity of mappings as often used in evolutionary computation constrains the dynamics of evolution to small space of possible biological or artificial systems evolution is not possible under such constraints &name by itself cannot fully explain the advant of genetic systems the flexible mappings heritable fitness this presents challenge both to biologists seeking to understand the capacity of life to evolve and to computer scientists who seek to harness robustness and openness in the evolution of artificial systems to what extent does evolvability require population of discrete individuals on which to act how can higher levels of sensory individuality arise &name has been variously defined as the genome ability to produce adaptive variants when acted on by the genetic system &name &name &num as the capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation &name &name &num and as characterized by evolutionary watersheds opening the floodgates to future evolution such as segmentation and body plans &name &num on the other hand unconstrained or inappropriately constrained variability and change can lead to lack of stability cancer nonheritability of fitness lack of evolutionary power and so on &name &name in natural evolution one finds impressive examples of the principle of exploiting and creating new sensory channels and information they carry &name tactile auditory and visual but also electrical and even magnetic senses have evolved in multitude of variants often utilizing organs not originally intended for the purpose they serve at present biologically evolving systems are able to adaptively construct their own hardware and software the new sensors create new ways of giving meaning to and interpreting the world many biological sensors reach degree of structural and functional complexity and of efficiency which is envied by engineers creating sensors sensors enable animals to survive in dynamic and unstructured environments to perceive and react appropriately to features in the biotic and abiotic environment including members of the own species as well as predators and prey &name artificial sensors for hardware or software systems suggests similar approach taken for generating behaviour namely using evolutionary techniques in order to explore design spaces and generate sensors which are specifically adapted with respect to environmental and other fitness related constraints the creation of channels of sensory input and effectory output lead to higher evolvability as new relevance criteria are developed that confer survival advantage to future offspring call for contributions we solicit abstracts for poster or oral

hey &name guess you looked at the website right making the corpus body of email data available to the academic community means just that the idea is that the anonymisation procedure removes any references to real people places organisations locations and then the corpus is used as benchmark training and testing resource for academics doing research into the junk email classification problem that means that they will use computers to generate statistical probabilities of certain words appearing at certain places in emails and then use these to classify new emails as either genuine or junk having corpus that multiple people test systems on is vital for reproducibility of experiments do worry noone as seen any of the emails you let me use obviously did use any of the &num from &name anyway the idea of the website is to convince people that it is safe to use the emails they donated as part of this corpus because it will be impossible to tell where the emails came from where they were sent to who they were about but this will only happen with explicit permission from the donor and if you not happy about yours being used in that way then that fine it still been really useful for me to use them thus far speak soon &name &name wed &num may &num &name &char &name wrote

hi have been trying to come to some sensible conclusions about which topic codes to select given some basic assumptions &num it would be nice to have several granularities of classification available in order to investigate performance thoroughly &num issues of data sparsity should be avoided if possible hence large training set &num using similar data to &name would save time and effort &num building on or at least comparing to &name &name work might be beneficial it seems sensible to mimic what &name is thinking of doing and make use of the &char and &char topic hierarchies the &char hierarchy provides both fine and medium granularities the use of both &char and &char gives coarse classification problem there are many documents in each hierarchy tempering any data sparsity problems in fact there are probably too many documents in the &char hierarchy especially and so perhaps only subset should be used for example the c1 documents and not the c2 c3 does this seem sensible to you have shell scripts running that retrieve the zip file and xml file name of each document belonging to each hierarchy but they take an extremely long time to run also in his &name &name says that some documents are assigned without being assigned the corresponding parent c18 without &name it seems to me that these should be taken as implied where they are not present but that may not be correct thanks &name &name &name &email prefer you handed in and signed off on something that had sensible estimte of filespace recquirements so do this after your lab reports &name incoming mail is certified virus free checked by &name system &website &name &name &num &name &name &num &num &num outgoing mail is certified virus free checked by &name system &website &name &name &num &name &name &num &num &num

group are also hosting &num master &name in &name how to gain competitive advantage it &name master &name will be hosted by &name &name and &name &name for further information please visit &website dear &name please find below this week issue of &name written exclusively by &name group analysts discovering strategy discovery whether of information by an individual or of services by an organisation is essential for the effective use of the &name the web is an increasingly tangled morass of data the vast majority of which is not relevant to specific searches nevertheless search engines are regularly deceived into delivering hits that will waste the time of any searcher this is annoying for an but potentially very expensive for business which will lose productive employee time to sifting through search results ensuring the filtering of information in dependable manner is therefore real business opportunity at both the individual and corporate levels and at present the dominant force in this space is &name the big &name &name has rapidly risen as force to be reckoned with in the search field due to the strength of its algorithms and rapid brand creation but it is now also positioning itself as potential rival to the established portal businesses such as &name &name and &name &name &name these sites have made considerable use of &name leading search technology which is increasingly placing them in potentially awkward positions on the &num hand &name searches are regularly driving new visitors to their sites and indeed &name has been utilising &name search technology since &num on the other &name is adding functionality and features such as news and shopping capabilities that undermine some of the core businesses involved in these sites and its influence is constantly growing as part of its response to this threat &name has recently acquired &name search company based on technology that failed to compete with &name no announcement has yet been made that &name will replace the use of &name at &name but this is clearly only matter of timing on the face of things this seems an uncertain strategy as the &name search technology is perceived as being inferior to that of &name however &name has clearly recognised that in order to protect its interests it must avoid any dependence on search technology particularly when this is provided by an increasingly competitive business much of the real value in the discovery market will be in the provision of searches in the web services arena which will attract corporate business emerging standards including the universal discovery description and &name &name and the recently announced will combine to simplify the process of providing and acquiring business services however these initiatives will not initially serve the needs of many smaller companies which will lack the developmental resources required to utilise them this leaves vast discovery market that the leading brand portals will be able to enter as providers of service &name group the search industry has consolidated very rapidly in recent years and &name is the clear winner at the individual user level if the portals are to succeed in preventing their core businesses from being leeched away by the expansion of &name into new territories they must begin to make more decisive moves to position themselves as credible service providers in the discovery space if this is to be done successfully it will require investments in both technology and brand creation the portals must position themselves as discovery service providers now which will require investments in search technology such as that made by &name or they may find that &name will dominate that market as well making data quality count it does matter how efficiently company &name or &name solutions are able to group and segment customers and their data to support the latest marketing campaign or promotional mail shot if the source data itself is of poor quality then the information extracted may already have been compromised when you also consider the high levels of project failure reported within customer facing it sectors it should be seen as fundamental issue to ensure that data quality and accuracy is made prime consideration the big &name many enterprise level organisations keep commercial information about their customers and the products and services that they provide across number of data stores sometimes this may cause an inability to correctly identify customers or alternatively to identify the same customers more than once all of which can cause important customers to receive incorrectly addressed duplicate or inappropriate information the results being possible lost sales opportunities money wasted on capturing and maintaining useless or duplicate records and probably most importantly from corporate perspective presenting an image to the outside world of inefficiency there are also other issues to be considered perhaps fraud prevention may be an important area especially to those delivering services in the financial sectors or the prevention of money laundering could be key issue in each case the quality of the source data is important and lack of data quality can lead to undesirable activities being hidden holding and maintaining records on database whether customer product or other record types has measurable cost both in terms of storage maintenance and support activities therefore the value that can be derived from deploying good quality data cleansing tool can be measured in number of ways including reduced staff costs in the customer support and systems maintenance areas reduced mailing costs by ensuring that offers made are correctly targeted and individual customer duplications are removed and increased sales revenue through having the ability to accurately identify and opportunities &name group &name very few vendors working in the mainstream &name &name and &name arenas would argue against the fact that data quality or lack thereof is one of the main issues when attempting to deliver effective business solutions our view would be that there are at least &num major areas of concern to be considered when looking at improving data quality within an organisation firstly there is the initial issue of data cleansing which often in the past has focused on attempts to clean up customer and associated data with specific goal in mind secondly and an issue for any organisation that is serious about the quality of data that it continues to maintain there is the question of how to permanently maintain data integrity once the initial cleansing exercise has been completed when selecting solution to imbed or run alongside mainstream infrastructure systems we would recommend that the selected system should be capable of providing both batch and cleansing facilities especially in environments where data change is dynamic and especially where customer contact is made on the basis of the organisations in depth knowledge of the customer spending before information despite figures that show that only &num in &num members of the public are accessing government web sites web sites would appear to be faring rather better as is usually the case the trend has been set in the us with customer sales reaching just under us &num billion in &num but it appears that the &name is now following &name and is in serious catch up mode with shopping growing &num times faster in the &name than in the us at present although consumers still have concerns over the security of sites there are advantages to shopping and it would appear that these advantages are at last making breakthrough the big &name the government has recently vowed to dedicate more funds to increasing the number of people who access its services however it appears that hardly have to try the interactive &org &name has found that &num million &name shoppers bought in november &num spending &num billion pounds this figure is expected to rise to more than &num in the next few months according to &name poll carried out on behalf of the department of trade and industry &name the &num billion pound figure for november is the biggest ever amount spent in the &name and represents &num rise on october figures and spectacular &num rise on the same period for the previous year the benefits of buying include time and monetary savings home delivery of goods and better consumer rights these benefits have however always been available and do not explain the huge rise in sales &name has been improved which may have helped to allay some people concerns although survey carried out by &name &name found that around &num of its respondents still felt uncomfortable giving out their credit card information and similar percentages were worried about the security of financial transactions and privacy in general the rise in broadband is also thought to be partly responsible for the rise in sales with its ability to make browsing and accessing sites even faster in the &name have been found to be better at converting browsers into customers ratings found that of the &num large developed economies they surveyed the &name converted the most browsers into paying customers other research by &name also revealed that more people would be prepared to shop if there were better guarantees about issues such as security and the quality of merchandise the &name government is helping to promote buying by for example publishing examples of people who have benefited by making purchases and generally promoting the message &name group &name ease of use issues are important where both government and web sites are concerned but at the end of the day shopping spending money on things you want or need especially from the comfort of your own home is far more attractive than finding out information mostly concerning the payment of bills or mundane issues such as rubbish collection it may also be case of preference and tradition people often wish to hear real person tell them local government type information or to deal with complaint but are quite happy to shop alone &name sites are adept at attracting browsers and enticing them to part with their cash and can be secure in the knowledge that improvements to security will result in increased numbers of consumers outlook wintry for &name it staff &num saw it jobs continuing to be axed by employers in the &name reductions in it spending reined in the requirement for development and integration expertise from consultancies as well as causing the loss of jobs amongst it staff it budgets are likely to be severely limited in &num with forecast growth as low as &num the big &name looking back only few years many factors combined to produce boom in &name it employment that will almost certainly never be repeated the recession of the early left businesses and the public sector with backlog of change requirements and facing looming deadline to do something to address the &name issue these circumstances saw many embark on the wholesale replacement of enterprise systems by customised redevelopment or more commonly by the procurement of package solutions both of which were readily supplied by hungry and helpful it industry &name of utilities and the rapid growth of the mobile industry were also significant drivers of it spending after the millennium and the loss of confidence in there has seemed an uncertainty about how to deploy it budget to best advantage the government determined spending is sole exception perhaps unfettered by such considerations organisations current it spending plans reveal the priorities for the near future to be asset protection and consolidation such investment as there is will be aimed towards security &name to derive value from existing data content management with the same objective or application integration to enhance value from legacy systems and other existing software like an increasing proportion of business requirements these will be addressed with maximum use of packaged solutions in order to hasten implementation and return on &name &name &name has proved attractive to many companies enabling them to reduce staff numbers and stabilise or reduce spending on it the service provider to whom it staff have been transferred use the human resources flexibly according to which of its customers need bodies from the pool of expertise achieving more efficient and dynamic deployment of staff overall the number of it resources required is reduced indeed the outsourcing providers themselves increasingly consolidate and merge gaining further efficiency via reduction in numbers of consultants &name group &name

dear &name while have great respect both personal and professional for all our past presidents regret that they have chosen to involve us as &name in this matter although the presidents state further down in their letter that they are actually divided over the boycott issue and over &name &name actions the first line of their letter reads we are writing in support of &name &name there is no doubt that this line will now receive wide citation in the campaign that supports &name &name both in her dispute with &name and in her personal boycott of &name nationals it may not have been their intention but with this choice of emphasis the presidents have given their name and ours for they say we may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the linguistics association of &name &name to campaign that says that it is right to limit individuals academic freedom if they have particular nationality that it is correct to ban fellow scholars not due to their poor professional ethics or even on the basis of their political views but simply because of their place of work for those of you who do know both of &name boycottees are prominent human rights activists and that it is legitimate to put political blame for the actions taken by government on individual fellow academics although this clearly only holds for &name working in &name assume that none of us would dream of boycotting say russian colleagues in protest against the flattening of &name or american colleagues in protest against civilian casualties in &name or turkish colleagues in protest against the still existing ban on using &name in public etc etc the presidents even go on to say that we all agree that the discrimination by &name against the &name raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention do not find that acting or arguing against boycotting individuals on the basis of their nationality rather than point of view or actions diverts either my attention or my energy away from engaging actively for peace in the middle east quite to the contrary as an &name who has been activley engaged in dialogue with palestinian friends and colleagues for over &num decades now feel that the only hope we have is to continue to make use of the freedoms we have as academics to meet and draft ideas for better future and for life in peace and collaboration in country which we must share recall that the talks that had led to the &name accords of the early &num which &name appears to oppose but which brought the only prospect of peace for over century had been initiated by palestinian and &name academics meeting abroad defying ban on contacts issued by hardliners on both sides if we restrict our own freedoms by banning contacts as &name wants we are doing service only to those whose aim is to separate our &num peoples and to prevent them from ever reaching any common ground the presidents raise concern over the potential infringement of &name liberty and say that whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in political action such as the boycott of the &name academic community is not an issue for the employing organisation strongly disagree &num cannot pretend that we are talking about what an individual acdemic is doing in her free time the issue is rather which standards of academic practice are being set in the public life of our own academic community &name actions were not personal they were public gestures by senior colleague aimed at changing the standards by which most of us operate as members of an academic association in this country it is our right and our duty to engage in debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour it is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate the issue of whether or not it is acceptable to ban fellow academics based on their nationality or country of residence or place of work belongs to the code of practice of this academic community the issue of whether or not &name discriminates the &name or &name the &name or &name the catholics in &name &name or how to react to such discrimination does not belong to that code of practice and is beyond the remit of either the &name or an academic institution like &name in this last respect very much regret the double standards that we seem to have in the &name last autumn at the &name business meeting proposed that we should react to the press reports concerning the &name secretary statements on the use of mother tongue by immigrants in their homes instead of deciding to act the assembly accepted proposal that should first establish what exactly had been said that should then put together report summarising current research on bilingualism in the family that should then draft reaction citing this research and then go on to poll the membership via this list and hope to come up with an agreed statement still to be issued before public opinion completely lost interest in the matter it turned out that &name had not said what some of the press attributed to him nonetheless his statement was ambiguous enough to deserve in my opinion reaction clarifying that it is incorrect and improper to suggest link between linguistic diversity and lack of modernity &name text suggested link between acquiring english and modernity while addressing the alleged monolingualism of large proportion of immigrants but it took many days to negotiate text to present on this list and even the text that was agreed on was not for some reason passed on to the list but was substituted by notice stripped of any evaluative content the &name was not it seemed as interested in reacting to an issue situated on its own doorstep and which demanded its profesional expertise as much as it enjoys the inspiration of &name &name ban them

for the attention of the library committee there has been request at the sscom for access to the library by students the initial request is believed to be from diploma students but there is feeling that this is likely to be the thin end of the wedge in order to guide the library committee in deciding the policy have been asked by the &name to write note about the technical and administrative issues involved access control to the &name and major areas within it is controlled by electronic locks operated by cards there are &num types of cards and associated reader the &name cards read by proximity readers the university card read by &name swipe readers at present students on taught courses other than the &name are not issued with &name cards they only have university cards just &num doors are fitted with &name readers alongside the &name readers student entrance &num door to &name and &num door to the west terrace therefore as things stand we cannot offer card access to the library for &name and diploma students possible solutions if we wish to do so are &num extend the unlocked hours all of the electronic doors can be put on time schedule which can be quite complex it is quite straightforward to extend the hours that the doors are unlocked giving access to anybody who can get into the building this could in principle be combined with paying somebody to supervise the library &num equip the &num doors on the route to the library with &name readers this will have capital cost it needs more than just the reader and it may be difficult to conceal the new wiring in the existing walls neatly it will also take time to organise &num &name all students with &name cards which would allow us control over the access each could have although superficially attractive it is precisely what we wanted to avoid when we took the decision to install &name support alongside &name there would be some cost in supplying the physical cards but this is small in comparison with the administrative burden of issuing cards handling lost cards the continuum system is such that the card handling procedures have not been as easy to automate as we had hoped and significant amount of computer officer time is required to deal with them &num as &num but restrict the card issue to individuals who make good case for it sticky door policy this is predicated on the assumption that relatively few students are likely to wish to use the library out of hours in practice the danger is that many would apply just in case or in the mistaken belief that the card would give access to the rest of the building we could consider discouraging this by charging deposit but it might be hard to justify this being more than the replacement value of the card under &num relatively trivial sum

brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and skateboard in the back of her sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash &name bills &num &num and hundreds all neatly in labelled piles first thought was that he had robbed bank says the woman there was over &num &num dollars in that bag that more than my husband earns in year the woman immediately called her husband at the where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via type of report to addresses that he obtained off the &name everyday after school for the past &num months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom just got the &num day and figured what the heck put

then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in &name bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the list &num get junk all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines but envelopes containing &num bills about week later rode my bike down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it there was also yellow slip that said had to go up to the post office counter thought was in trouble or something laughs he goes on went up to the counter and they had whole box of more mail for me had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the the money just kept coming in and just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework &name had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the &num bills for &num &num and hundreds &website reporting news team examined and investigated the the boy was sending out and found that it was not at &name fact it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name &name &num section &num and &num or title &num section &num in the us code also in the code of federal regulations &name &num sections &num and &num which state product or service must be exchanged for money received every bill that he received contained little note that read please send me

individuals save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the &num of people who will order them from you also make floppy of these reports and keep it in your desk in case something happens to your computer important do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in step &num through &num or you will loose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it does not work if you change it remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work people have tried to put their friends relatives names on all &num thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember &name reaps the reward this is legitimate business you are offering product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in short period of time after you have ordered all &num reports take this advertisement and remove the name address of the person in report &num this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune email them and ask that what always &name the

only &num &num each let also assume that the mailing receives only &num &num &num of &num response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &num also many people will send out hundreds of thousands instead of only &num &num each continuing with this example you send out only &num &name with &num response that is only &num orders for report &num those &num people responded by sending out &num &num each for total of &num &num out of those &num &num only &num responded with orders people responded and ordered report &num those &num people mail out &num &num each for total

hi &name quick question have been looking at perplexity values for the lms generated and find that on the whole the test set perplexities for the bigrams are significantly higher than for the unigrams this is undoubtedly due to the fact that whenever bigram is unseen backoff to the unigram distribution but since the probabilities are calculated over the discounted probability mass they are much lower than in the standard unigram case however the bigrams still perform significantly better because even though the unigram probabilities are much smaller they are still correctly proportioned thus it seems that comparing perplexities for different ngrams is basically pointless what do you think &char

&name toolkit the toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification summarisation mining and querying it is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems which go beyond pure term indexing or entity extraction the &name toolkit is package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to properties predicated of these relations and relations which hold between them for instance the following text the transcript of president &name speech at the &name museum center on 7th october &num is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath members of the &name of both political parties and members of &org &org agree

the &org the council relations the &name &name be is threat the council &name be is threat the &name &name must disarm the council &name must disarm the actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats href systems represent text documents as bags of words sets of characters between white spaces but will not directly recover the entities referred to in document such as &name &name political parties &org &org or members of &name of both political parties representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents such as the &name &name council or the &org and thus also better way of classifying summarising or querying document content via salient entities the &name system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in way into names subdivided into places people organisations numbers including ranges dates etc measure phrases ounce year etc temporal expressions days weeks months directions north south etc and so forth relational representation of entities provides natural and effective mechanism for alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations href extant systems for extracting entities from text based on deterministic pattern matching rely heavily on lexical information from the outset the relational information recovered by the &name system can be used to index who did what to whom and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across document collection relational pattern like the &name &name council agree what does the &name &name council agree can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise specific and small amounts of focussed information this approach to information retrieval deals naturally with text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation the &org the &name &name council as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems such as negation the council not agree &name must disarm neq the council

ok the problem is this already got log &char &char and log &char &char because calculating probabilities in log space to avoid underflow thus have to find the equivalent of interpolating in the normal probability space &name is that normal interpolation requires addition which does have an equivalent in the log space thus the only thing can think of is to scale and convert back to normal probs but this still might cause problems with under overflow if the probabilities are markedly different any further ideas be grateful thanks &name &name on &name &num &name &num &name &name wrote

commissioning process for example as might occur for the creation of material for the head of department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and the transfer of copyright as far as he was aware no such commissioned material for teaching under the syndicate jurisdiction had been produ ced it was his belief that if the syndicate felt that there was case for material to be commissioned for example for an course then he would consult the department before proceeding he suggested that license to use rather

at snail &name by &name &name barge cruise is different breed of cruise it &num degree departure from what most people think of when you mention cruising the biggest difference is size barge cruises are intimate affairs where cruise ship can have passenger list that numbers in the hundreds or thousands barge that cruises on canal usually has fewer than &num passengers the &name which sailed in the heart of &name &name from &name to &name can carry up to &num passengers but there were only &num passengers on our trip for &num days the &name was our floating hotel the place where we ate slept relaxed and socialized served by french crew and chef british hotel manager and australian tour guide there is no gambling bingo dance classes or other distractions as the large cruise ships offer evening entertainment on the &name usually depends on how much the passengers want to interact the cruise line does schedule &num evening of entertainment in the cruise &char local musician presided over an evening of festivities band he sang french standards in english while playing keyboard after the obligatory french songs the rest of the evening he belted out an array of american rock classics our floating hotel provided us with all meals during the cruise prepared by our onboard master chef &name the service was as elegant as the food with table tops decked out in cleverly folded linen napkins with different design for each meal breakfast the most casual of the meals is on table topped with warm croissants and breads fruits cheeses and even cold cereals to cater to american tastes wine is served with lunch and dinner paired to each course and fully stocked bar compliments cocktail hour barge cruise has no litany of cruise ports instead you choose barge by the region it sails for instance in &name you can choose &name &name &name or &name barge cruises are also available in &name &name &name and &name excursions are included and built into the &name itinerary unlike conventional cruise ship where passengers pour out at each port and may overwhelm that port we trickled from the &name we easily blended into the pace of life at small villages and were able to meet and talk to the local people there no need for remedies as the &name floats along on calm canal waters during the journey the barge passed through locks each lock is overseen by local lock keeper and manually operated lock keepers are assigned several locks like to life in the early &num when their duty is finished at &num lock they hop on their bicycles and speed to the next lock always reaching it well ahead of the barge rustic little stone lock houses many with lace curtains and pots overflowing with colorful flowers add nostalgic flavor to the like scenery and stand sentinel at each lock another major difference is speed the &name offers relaxed pace you float along nearly still canal at about &num miles an hour or as the cruise line literature says at pace every few kilometers the barge stops to transit canal lock while the barge sits in the lock rising or lowering to the next plateau passengers can get on and off the barge bicycles are on board each barge so passengers can ride along the path that parallels the canal the &name travels so slow that you can ride bike walk at your own speed or explore the surroundings and easily meet up with the barge &name one of the passengers who loved to walk for his daily exercise would power ahead on the path and wait for the &name to arrive several locks down while &name went other passenger simply sat on the &name outside deck and watched the countryside drift by this freedom lets you be as active or inactive as you choose excursions do compete with sailing each day featured trip by bus to nearby town passengers return from excursions for lunch as soon as the lunch dishes are cleared the &name starts to sails along the canal headed toward that evening mooring the &num optional trip many of the passengers took was
